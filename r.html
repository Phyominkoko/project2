		<p class="text-light">Looking back on it after the event, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge described joining FC Bayern in 1974 as a “kamikaze mission.” The club had just won the Bundesliga three times in a row, so how was an unknown 18-year-old striker from Borussia Lippstadt supposed to break into the team?

But Rummenigge succeeded. He was a regular by the time of his second season with FCB in 1975/76, and made his full international debut for Germany on 6 October 1976. His main attributes were dynamism, pace and utter conviction, combined with an exceptional nose for goal. His career stats show that he scored more than a goal every two games in a red shirt as he finished on 162 goals in 310 Bundesliga appearances and ranks as the club’s second highest all-time scorer behind Gerd Müller.

Extensive medal collection
Rummenigge won a host of medals and awards in his time with FC Bayern: he was top scorer in the Bundesliga three times (1980, 1981, 1984), Player of the Year in Germany (1980) and Europe (1980, 1981), Intercontinental Cup winner (1976), European Cup winner (1975, 1976), European Cup Winners’ Cup winner (1982, 1984), and German champion (1980, 1981). He was also a European championship winner with Germany in 1980.

“Kalle” left Bayern at the end of the 1984 season, joining Inter Milan for the then record fee of almost €6 million. He moved on in 1987 and wound down his playing career in a two-year spell with Servette Geneva. “I say goodbye gladly, because I've lived and enjoyed this job to the full for 15 years,” he said after hanging up his boots. Rummenigge was a model professional who only ever hit the headlines for his deeds on the pitch and not off it. Always careful to avoid controversy and scandal, he remains a firm believer in correct behaviour and discipline to this day.

		<p class="text-light">Karl-Heinz Rummenigge might not be the first name that comes to mind when thinking about Bayern Munich and Germany legends.

Coming into his own in the aftermath of Franz Beckenbauer and Gerd Müller, Rummenigge was the poster boy for Bayern Munich in the early '80s as he helped to bring in a new era of dominance to Bavaria - winning seven Bundesliga titles during that decade.

It wasn't quite their 'Golden Era', but Rummenigge laid the foundations for FC Hollywood to take shape not long after and he had more than a handful of outstanding moments along the way too.'Kalle' Rummenigge first appeared on the Ballon d'Or shortlist in 1979, ahead of Ruud Krol but still some way behind Kevin Keegan, who was playing his club football in Germany with Hamburger SV.

But the following year there really was only one clear winner. Rummenigge had lifted the Bundesliga title where he'd finished as the league's top goalscorer, also helping West Germany to glory at international level.

It was Rummenigge's first Ballon d'Or. But it wasn't his last.</p>
