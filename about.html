		<p class="text-light p-4">Football is a team sport in which two teams play against each other to score their spherical ball in the other opponents net (what we call a ‘goal’). Both teams usually have 11 players in different positions on the pitch. Each positions main aim is to keep the opposing team from scoring a goal in their net. It’s a strategic game and requires tenacity and skill. Players also tackle and battle to get the ball from opposing teams to overall try and score a goal for themselves.

In America, football is referred to as ‘soccer’. It’s estimated that around 200 countries play the game which totals to around 250 million players!Football positions on the pitch:

Goalkeeper - The keeper stays in the net and protects it trying to stop and save balls from going in their goal.
Right Fullback - positioned on the right side of the pitch and is a defending position.
Left Fullback - Similar to the right but on the opposite side.
Centre Back - Their role is to defend the central side of the pitch.
Defender/back - These players are closest to the net and help the goalkeeper.
Left/Right Midfielder - These players can also be referred to as 'wingers' and they stay wide trying to pull the opponent’s defence to create space to achieve a goal.
Central Midfielder - Plays defensively and offensively, they are responsible for kicking the ball strategically to other players.
Striker - This is an offensive position and is positioned nearest to the opposing team’s goal. Their main job is to score a goal.
Attacking Midfielder - These players sit between the midfield and offensive line, they must have good dribbling skills. Their main job is to create scoring opportunities.

<h2 class="text-light p-4">Football Rule</h2>
<img src="img/football 22.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block w-50" alt="...">

<p class="text-light p-4 ">Each match is 45 minutes long with two halves to allow for a 15-minute break in between.
No player (apart from the goalkeeper) should touch the ball if a player touches the ball the opposing team gets a penalty and is called ‘handball’.
A maximum of 11 players are allowed and a minimum of 7.
To score a goal the ball must be in the opposing teams net and must be fully in, meaning it has successfully crossed the line, the goal can be scored from any part of the body apart from your hands.
The football used must be 58-61cm and be a circular shape.
Players must wear protective gear including shin pads and the correct boots.
Each side is allowed a maximum of three substitutions each, in case any player isinjured or the game rolls into extra time.
The winning team is the one who scores the most goals. If a match results in both teams scoring the same, the match will end in a draw. If it’s a cup game extra time can be added which is an extra 30 minutes.
Each game must have a referee and two assistants. It’s the referee's job to make sure the game is being played fair, they can rule penalties, plus give yellow and red cards.
A yellow card is a warning, two of them would result in a red card and a player being taken off the pitch. If this is the case a player in this situation cannot be replaced.
If a ball goes out of the pitch (out of play) then it can be played as a ‘throw in’ in which a player throws the ball back into the game.
If a ball goes out of play on the baseline of an attacking player, they get a goal kick (e.g penalty) But if it comes from a defending player it’s a corner kick.
